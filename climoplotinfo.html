<p>Sounding climatology plots were calculated using historical sounding data available internally at the Storm Prediction Center.
Derived parameters were calculated using the numerical calculation routines developed for the N-SHARP sounding analysis program.
The raw dataset represents the complete record of routine soundings, with only values that are physically unrealistic (e.g., negative values of precipitable water) removed from the dataset.
The filtered dataset includes a more aggressive set of filters, designed to remove extreme outliers with a high probability of being erroneous.
A combination of subjectively determined lower and upper bounds, and a pre-determined number of standard deviations (typically 4-7) recalculated each month for every parameter, were used as filtering thresholds.
Additionally, a set of unique filters was developed to remove unrealistic values of computed instability parameters (e.g., CAPE) by cross-checking with other parameters.
However, due to the very large sample size, it is difficult to filter out all erroneous data using an automated scheme, and it is likely a small subset of the included dataset contains observational errors.</p>

<p>Incomplete or noisy plots are usually a result of a small sample size. Blank plots are often a result of the altitude of the sounding location.</p>

<p>Lastly, the moving average lines represent a 91-day centered moving average, although a user can change the number of days to whatever he or she would like.
The 91-day time period was chosen in order to smooth data over an approximate seasonal period.</p>
